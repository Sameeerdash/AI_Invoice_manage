# AI-Enabled B2B Invoice Management System
This repository contains the source code and documentation for an AI-enabled B2B invoice management system that I developed during my summer internship at HighRadius. The goal of the project was to build a robust system capable of accurately predicting order amounts using machine learning techniques.

## Key Features
Machine Learning Model: Developed and implemented machine learning models using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. These models were trained on historical data to predict order amounts with a high level of accuracy.

Java Servlets for API Calls: Utilized Java servlets to handle API calls for data fetching and performed CRUD operations. This allowed for seamless integration with the backend systems and ensured efficient retrieval and manipulation of data.

Frontend Development with React JS: Designed and developed the frontend of the application using React JS. This resulted in a user-friendly and responsive interface, providing a smooth experience for users interacting with the system.
